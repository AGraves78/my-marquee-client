This application serves as my final project while attending Gainesville Dev Academy. I plan to continue working on this project. At this time, it provides a method for searching movies by title. The movie data was obtained using the API from The Movie Database at https://www.themoviedb.org.

I began building this application for my personal use. The ultimate goal and purpose of this application was to provide me with a way to search for movies and add them to a watchlist of movies I would like to see. This would include a search by title and browsing by genre. In the watchlist, I would have the ability to check off movies that I have seen or add them to a viewed list.

As I continue to work on this project, I would like to add additional styling, and improve the overall design, appearance, and usability of the app. In the future, I may implement a user database for storing watchlists by user.
